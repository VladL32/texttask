            Does she need to be an empathetic leader ? Ask about that . Does she need to take your company public ?
            Ask about that . If you're the candidate , talk about why you took certain jobs . Explain why you left .
            Explain why you chose a certain school . Share why you decided to go to grad school .
            Discuss why you took a year off to backpack through Europe, and what you got out of the experience .
            What are  your  biggest  weaknesses ? Every  candidate  knows  how  to  answer  this question :
            Just pick a theoretical weakness and magically transform that flaw into a strength in disguise ! For example:
            " My biggest weakness is getting so absorbed in my work that I lose all track of time . 
            Every day I look up and realize everyone has gone home ! I know I should be more aware of the clock ,
            but when I love what I'm doing I just can't think of anything else . "So your " biggest weakness " is that you'll 
            put  in  more  hours  than  everyone  else ?  Great. What  are  your  biggest strengths ? I'm not sure why 
            interviewers ask this question ; your resume and experience should make your strengths readily apparent !
            Even so , if you're asked , provide a sharp , on-point answer . Be clear and precise ! If you're a great problem solver , 
            don't just say that: Providea few examples , pertinent to the opening , that prove you're a great problem solver ! 
            If you're an emotionally intelligent leader , don't just say that !
